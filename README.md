# Under Construction
To run this, just use:
```
shiny::runApp("app/")
```
You just need to give the ``` runApp()``` function the directory where the ```ui.r``` and ```server.r``` are.
It seems that the app works better on Firefox than on Chrome, and the UI is better rendered.

Loading the libreries might take some time, the UI will load but the packages need to be loaded to wrok properly.
